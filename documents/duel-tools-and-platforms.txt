# Duel Tools and Platforms

**Tools & Platforms**

Here is a quick outline of all the tools and platforms that we use internally and what they are for:

**CharlieHR**

We use CharlieHR to store all employee documents, book leave, annual reviews. This is one of our new platforms so we’ll be building out more on this as we go!

**Google Drive**

This is where we store all our documents and files, from presentations to contracts and applications - everything is saved on Drive. Mia or your Line Manager will share the most relevant folders with you during your time at Duel.

**Google Calendar**

This is where our meetings, calls, drinks and lunches are scheduled. You can view what is going on with each team member and see when they are available. We also have an Events, Holidays and Birthdays calendars which will be shared with you too.

**Slack**

Slack is the go to place for most of our office communication. With multiple channels to share articles, feedback, urgent web bugs or questions. Mia will add you to all the relevant channels and the team chat. You can check out the full details of how we use Slack [here](https://www.notion.so/acde0ffc2873419a876e68ea619d6511?pvs=21).

**Hubspot & Hubspot CRM**

HubSpot is currently the host of our site, our inbound machine and our CRM. A company account will be created for you if required by your pod.

The CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tool on HubSpot is mainly used by our sales team. Here you will be able to find all of Duel’s deals, sales contacts, history of emails and tasks. You will get access to this only if you’re in the sales team.

**Zoom**

We often use Zoom for our external meetings - predominantly used by the Demand Generation and Pipeline Team, as well the People Pod for recruitment activities. You'll be set up on a premium plan by Mia if required for your role!

**Teamtailor**

We use Teamtailor for our recruitment activities to store our notes and our candidate database! Predominantly used by the People Pod, but often used by other members of the team for feedback when part of the hiring process for a role. You'll be brought up to speed on Teamtailor if the need occurs!

**Trello**

This is our go-to Project Management tool. We mainly use Trello boards to manage and monitor tasks in our Product Development pipeline. Here you will be able to see what is being worked on, people responsible and so on. The team will let you know when you need to be on-boarded onto Trello - but do let someone know if you have any questions or if you are unable to view something that you can't!

**Additional suggestions**

**Evernote**

Some of us also use Evernote for note taking - it’s a great tool to keep your notes organised and in one place.

**Notes**

Similarly to Evernote - feel free to use MacBook Notes for note taking before transferring them on to Pipedrive or wherever is relevant.

## **Extensions**

These will save you! Install these Chrome extensions as and when you see fit (but note that most of these don't work on Safari, so best to move to Chrome).
